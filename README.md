# Tic-Tac-Toe
1. Description
   -->Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or         diagonal. Players alternate turns, placing their marks in empty cells. The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, or when all cells are filled without any player winning, resulting in a             draw. This simple yet engaging game is often used for educational purposes and as a recreational activity for players of all ages.

2. How to Play
   --> Here, you can choose your mark for 'X' or 'O' for playing. By default, your mark is 'X' and you will be playing against a computer. That's the awesome part. When you win or lose, a winning or losing sound             will ring along with some message for you. That shows the conclusion of the match. And the reset button can reset the game for you.
